intro = "The nuisance dragon still persisted, a pain in the Dragonslain’s backside. But the next of Osric’s descendents to puff their chest was Hildegarde. 
Mother to ten feisty children, known around Dragonnosh as Big Hilde. The woman was robust as all hell and ready to thoroughly scold the dragon with a maternal screech.
"
traitor = "Fueled by the pent-up maternal rage her ten children had inflicted over the years, Hildegarde completely lost her temper and took it out on her fellow villagers. 
Triggered by their own memories of angry mothers, they lashed back and killed Hilde. 
"
death = "As all ten children peered from the window of their abode, the dragon finally wore down Big Hilde. 
However, her legendary stubbornness meant she refused to turn to ash and instead turned to stone. It took the villagers a long time to move her. Classic Hilde!
"
victory = "Hildegarde pointed her bow at the dragon like she would point her finger at her children and yelled, “NO.” 
Either by an arrow to the eye or the ferocity of a mother’s rebuke, the dragon was slain. Do not test Big Hilde, that’s the moral of this folktale. 
"
forgivness = ""
well = "“Little children steer clear of the well, So deep and dark, if it echoes your yell.” 
Big Hilde should have taken the rhyme more seriously as she tumbled to her grave.
