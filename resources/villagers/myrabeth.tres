intro = "This is a tale of a lady called Myrabeth, descendant of Osric the Dragonslain. With a heart of zeal she set out to avenge  and slay the monster who burnt him to a crisp.
Myrabeth returned to the cursed village on the annual day of the Dragonnosh barbecue. Myrabeth primed her bow and hollered, “For Osric!”"
traitor = "Perhaps Myrabeth’s rage had taken over her mind as she turned on the villagers around her. Dropping like flies they went, taken down by their own friend. Not cool. "
death = "The dragon's onyx eyes locked onto Myrabeth.  
“Ahh.” It growled, “Osric’s blood. Let’s make Dragonslain a family name shall we.”
Within a second Myrabeth was roast meat.
And so Dragonslain did become a family name, as you will see. "
victory = "The vengeful fury coursed through Myrabeth, imbuing her arrows with strength. THUD. Into the dragon's heart an arrow found its mark.
The villagers forever told the story of Myrabeth the vengeful and how her magic arrows ceased the dragon breath. They did also question if she was a witch and considered burning at the stake. But they’d had enough fire for a century."
forgivness = ""
well = "The fear of the dragon was so overwhelming that Myrabeth went to hide in a well. She  must have forgotten that wells usually contain a sheer drop. Death was slow and painful. Even the dragon was embarrassed.”"
